# Tic-Tac-Android
A simple tic-tac-toe game for an Android 2.2 system.  Uses Java.

Contains two files:
MainActivity.java is the main activity page that contains program control.
R.java contains the code that dictates the screen layout, it is a derived file.


Currently working on an easy way to install and run the program based on just these three files, currently I am running it through eclipse.
