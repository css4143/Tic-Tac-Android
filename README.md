# Tic-Tac-Android
A simple tic-tac-toe game for an Android 2.2 system.  Uses Java.

Contains three files:
MainActivity.java is the main activity page that contains program control.
R.java contains the code that dictates the screen layout.
BuildConfig.java dictates the debug mode.

Currently working on an easy way to install and run the program based on just these three files, currently I am running it through eclipse.
